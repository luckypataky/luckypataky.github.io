<p><strong>Machine Learning based vibration and acoustic pattern classification</strong> (ME 231 project, December 2025)</p>
<p>
Developed a machine learning–based classification framework to identify operating conditions of a rotating machine using vibration and acoustic signals. Designed and conducted laboratory experiments to collect multi-sensor time-series data from accelerometers and microphones under multiple operating states, including normal and fault-induced conditions. Processed raw vibration and acoustic time-series signals into frequency-domain features using FFTs and spectrograms, and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify machine states with high accuracy. Validated model performance through testing and analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-driven methods for condition monitoring and early fault detection in rotating systems.

<p><strong>Mini Segway Self-Balancing MinSeg Robot</strong> (ME190 mechatronics project, Fall 2024)</p>
<p>
Modeled and controlled a two-wheeled self-balancing robot using MATLAB and Simulink by deriving and linearizing the electromechanical dynamics into a state-space formulation. Designed and tuned full-state feedback and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers to stabilize the system under varying initial tilt angles while constraining actuator voltage. Implemented real-time feedback control using encoder, accelerometer, and gyroscope measurements, evaluated controller robustness, and validated upright balancing performance through simulation and hardware testing.

<p><strong>Transient Heat Transfer in a Pipe</strong> (ME 230 project, Spring 2024)</p>
<p>
Transient heat transfer behavior of a hot fluid flowing through an insulated pipe connecting two houses under winter weather conditions is analyzed mathematically using the finite difference method (FDM) in Python. The governing equations representing the thermal behavior are derived using forward, central, and backward difference approximations, and the results are plotted to study time-dependent heat loss at different times of the day. The analysis estimates thermal equilibrium under steady-state conditions and aids in insulation design, including selection of appropriate insulation thickness and material to reduce heat dissipation.
</p>

<p><strong>Microfluidics heat transfer in a microchannel design</strong> (ME 168 project, Fall 2023)</p>
<p>
Investigated heat transfer within a microchannel, by designing an H-shaped microchannel having two inlets on the left side, two outlets on the right side and the middle bridge as the central mixing channel. A fluid in two streams, each at a different temperature entered the inlets, mixed in the central channel, and exited through the outlets. The temperatures at the outlets were measured to study the impact of channel width on the temperature gradient of the fluid. The fabrication process was elaborated on in the procedures that followed the completion of the photolithography mask.
</p>

<p><strong>Bike Pedal Wrench Design Optimization using ANSYS FEA</strong> (ME 273 project, Fall 2023)</p>
<p>
Redesigned and optimized a bike pedal wrench using ANSYS Workbench to reduce mass while maintaining structural integrity and functional requirements. Performed static structural analysis, mesh refinement, and design sensitivity studies to evaluate stress, reaction moment, and safety factor under realistic loading conditions. Applied geometry optimization to achieve approximately 17% mass reduction while meeting strength and torque constraints, and validated the final design through finite element simulations.
</p>

<p><strong>Robot Hand Project</strong> (ASME Chapter, San José State University, May 2022)</p>
<p>
Built a 3D-printed robotic hand based on the open-source InMoov design. Contributed to CAD modification and mechanical assembly by redesigning and printing finger and string-routing components in SolidWorks. Researched, procured motors, and led electronics and control implementation using an Arduino Uno with Python (Firmata/pyFirmata) for real-time finger open/close control, overcoming MicroPython compatibility limitations.
</p>

<p><strong>Load lift up/down by 45-degree angle: 4-bar mechanism</strong> (ME154 project, Fall 2022)</p>
<p>
Used 4 bar mechanism to lift a load up and down by 45-degree angle. Used Fusion360 CAD software to sketch the 4-bar linkage mechanism. Then created the 3D models of the bars and the load box. Assembled the models and animated it to ensure operation per design criteria. Created a working physical prototype model by 3D printed all the parts and assembling them to a wooden base using hardware.
</p>

<p><strong>Python Grade Calculation App</strong> (City College of San Francisco, 2018)</p>
<p>
Coding involved: Reading test scores from external files (file I/O), basic command line user interface popping up menu and prompting for user input, creating student accounts, searching students, viewing, editing, removing grades, calculating and assigning letter grades, validating calculation correctness, handling input file errors and output, generating user-configured output files, and creating a low-grade attention notification system for instructors.
