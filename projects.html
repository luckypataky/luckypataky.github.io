<h3>Machine Learning based vibration and acoustic pattern classification (ME 231)</h3>
<p>
Developed a machine learning–based classification framework to identify operating conditions of a rotating machine using vibration and acoustic signals. Designed and conducted laboratory experiments to collect multi-sensor time-series data from accelerometers and microphones under multiple operating states, including normal and fault-induced conditions. Processed raw vibration and acoustic time-series signals into frequency-domain features using FFTs and spectrograms, and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify machine states with high accuracy. Validated model performance through testing and analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-driven methods for condition monitoring and early fault detection in rotating systems.

<h3>Mini Segway Self-Balancing MinSeg Robot (ME190)</h3>
<p>
Modeled and controlled a two-wheeled self-balancing robot using MATLAB and Simulink by deriving and linearizing the electromechanical dynamics into a state-space formulation. Designed and tuned full-state feedback and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers to stabilize the system under varying initial tilt angles while constraining actuator voltage. Implemented real-time feedback control using encoder, accelerometer, and gyroscope measurements, evaluated controller robustness, and validated upright balancing performance through simulation and hardware testing.

<h3>Transient Heat Transfer in a Pipe</h3>
<p>
Transient heat transfer behavior of a hot fluid flowing through an insulated pipe connecting two houses under winter weather conditions is analyzed mathematically using the finite difference method (FDM) in Python. The governing equations representing the thermal behavior are derived using forward, central, and backward difference approximations, and the results are plotted to study time-dependent heat loss at different times of the day. The analysis estimates thermal equilibrium under steady-state conditions and aids in insulation design, including selection of appropriate insulation thickness and material to reduce heat dissipation.

<h3>Bike Pedal Wrench Design Optimization using ANSYS FEA</h3>
<p>
Redesigned and optimized a bike pedal wrench using ANSYS Workbench to reduce mass while maintaining structural integrity and functional requirements. Performed static structural analysis, mesh refinement, and design sensitivity studies to evaluate stress, reaction moment, and safety factor under realistic loading conditions. Applied geometry optimization to achieve approximately 17% mass reduction while meeting strength and torque constraints, and validated the final design through finite element simulations.
